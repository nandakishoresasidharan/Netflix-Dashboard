# Netflix Content Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

# Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix’s Movies & TV Shows dataset to discover trends in content production, genres, and global distribution. The dataset was cleaned using Python and visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

# Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset
- **Columns:** show_id, title, director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, description

# Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Handled Missing Values**
   - Director, cast, country, date_added, rating, duration filled using mode/most frequent values or with 'Unknown'.
2. **Removed Duplicates**
   - Based on `title` and `release_year`.
3. **Standardized Formats**
   - Country names, date formats, and rating categories cleaned for consistency.
4. **Kept Duration as Text**
   - Preserved original movie/TV season format for analysis.
